ðŸŽ‰ Just built a Student Registration Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

It captures user data (Name, Age, Gender, Course, and Email) and dynamically adds it to a styled table using **DOM manipulation**. ðŸ’»âœ¨

What I learned from this project:
âœ… Handling user input through forms  
âœ… Working with the DOM in JavaScript  
âœ… Creating and updating HTML elements dynamically  
âœ… Styling forms and tables for a clean UI

This small project boosted my confidence in JavaScript and helped me understand how real-world forms work on websites.

One step closer to becoming a frontend developer! ðŸš€
